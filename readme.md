This is my fourth task given to me as a cyber-security intern at Prodigy InfoTech.
This Python script makes use of the pynput package to create a simple keylogger.
It records every key pushed into a text file called "keylog.txt" while listening for keyboard events. 
Keystrokes are recorded in real time by the script, which runs endlessly until it is stopped.
